Abitlity to configure the attribute names and values in sightly via arbitary text

1. Currently I have a requirement around making data attributes configurable for an anchor. An example use case would be

<a href="#" data-sly-attribute."Name1"="Value1" data-sly-attribute."Name2"="Value2" data-sly-attribute."Name3"="Value3">
  Click me
</a>

Where name1,value1,name2,value2,name3,value3 are content authored via a multifield.

I have a sigtly use model logic which processes the multifield and constructs the attributes as an arbitary string given below

 String attribuite = "data-sly-name1=value1 data-sly-name2=value2 data-sly-name3=value3";
 
However, I cannot use this in my sightly html file as shown below
 
 <a href="#" ${attribute}>
  Click me  
 </a>
 
Is there a way around it ?? or do I have to resort to JSP's?? Let me know if you need a code sample
